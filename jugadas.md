## Short or Frontal Plays

### Bulita

**Objective:** Create a 3 vs 2 situation in midfield.

**Description:**
The Bulita play seeks to create numerical superiority with the fly-half, inside center, and blindside wing against the opposing fly-half and inside center.

**Execution:**
1. The fly-half must fix their direct opponent
2. The inside center commits their opposing center and seeks a short angle to the inside shoulder, running flat
3. The blindside wing stays hidden behind the fly-half until the last moment to avoid detection
4. When the inside center changes angle, the blindside wing appears
5. The outside center must draw the opposing outside center away to isolate the 3 vs 2

**Passing options:**
- To the inside center on a short angle
- To the blindside wing who appears by surprise
- Both options must be viable simultaneously

### Bandeja/Maca/Pomelo

**Objective:** Create multiple attacking options with coordinated crosses.

**Description:**
Play with three variants that share the same base but differ in the blindside wing's movement.

**Base execution (Bandeja):**
1. The fly-half runs straight then cuts toward the inside shoulder of the opposing inside center
2. Appearing simultaneously:
   - Inside center crossing
   - Outside center on a short angle
3. The fly-half must keep their legs moving after the cross to create space

**MACA variant:**
- The blindside wing crosses after the inside center passes

**POMELO variant:**
- The blindside wing loops behind the outside center

**Key:** All three options (inside center, outside center, wing) must be possible almost simultaneously.

### Adelante

**Objective:** Generate a 3 vs 2 with movement toward the openside.

**Execution:**
1. The fly-half aims directly at the opposing inside center
2. The inside center mimics their run toward the opposing outside center
3. The outside center crosses behind both
4. The blindside wing goes toward the openside behind the inside center

**Final options:**
1. Pass to the inside center short (direct penetration)
2. Pass to the crossing outside center (attack against the grain)
3. Pass to the blindside wing (numerical superiority outside if the opposing outside center closes down)

---

### Boca

**Direction:** ALWAYS from left to right to avoid marking by the opposing scrum-half.

**Description:**
The centers run almost identical lines: straight toward the defense, finding space at the last moment.

**Execution:**
1. The fly-half must worry the opposing inside center
2. The centers run straight and parallel lines
3. At the last moment they find spaces to receive from the fly-half
4. The blindside wing loops behind the centers as a trailer, but not too deep to maintain passing quality

**Critical point:** The outside center (13) must arrive higher upfield than the inside center (12) so both passes are possible.

---

### Bufetero

**Objective:** Centers cross without the ball to confuse the defense.

**Description:**
The outside center comes short in front and the inside center goes long behind. The blindside wing supports inside.

**Execution:**
1. The centers' running lines are initially parallel and straight forward
2. The outside center can start flatter if necessary, but without making the movement obvious
3. When the outside center changes angle, they do so toward a specific space: **outside shoulder of the opposing 12, NOT toward the fly-half**
4. At that moment, the inside center drifts slightly outward with depth
5. The inside center (12) must "let go" of the outside center (13) for the drift to work

**Reception options:**
- Outside center short (if they see a gap outside the opposing 12)
- Inside center long (with blindside wing inside)
- Blindside wing direct from the fly-half (if there's a large gap between centers)

## Long Plays

### Quilombo

**Objective:** Generate a loop from the fly-half with multiple continuity options.

**Execution:**
1. The fly-half passes to the inside center
2. The inside center attacks forward, supported by the outside center on the outside
3. The outside center maintains a straight or outward running line until the last moment
4. At the last moment, the outside center corrects inward
5. **If the opposing outside center doesn't close down:** the pass goes directly to the outside center in midfield
6. The fly-half loops behind the outside center
7. The fly-half has support from the blindside wing behind them
8. They also have support from the fullback and openside wing outside

**Options after the loop:**
1. Pass to the outside center (13) running flat
2. Keep with the fly-half with blindside wing support
3. Flat skip pass to the fullback (15)
4. Outside play if the defense is closed

### Francia

**Direction:** ALWAYS from left to right to avoid marking by the opposing scrum-half.

**Execution:**
1. The inside center runs straight toward the defense
2. At the last moment finds space to receive from the scrum-half
3. The scrum-half receives from the number 8 and seeks to engage the opposing fly-half with their running line
4. The fly-half loops behind the center, but not too deep so the scrum-half has a quality pass

**Scrum-half options:**
1. Inside center running flat
2. Fly-half looping behind
3. Blindside wing behind
4. Blindside wing on a crash line

**Key:** The blindside wing can play inside of the fly-half if the opposing inside center doesn't arrive from inside.

**Fundamental principle:** The centers must find spaces, NOT aim at the defender's body. This fixes the defenders. If they don't get fixed, call for the ball directly.

**If space is outside:** STRAIGHTEN and pass to the outside center.

### Lanzini

**Direction:** ALWAYS from right to left to avoid marking by the opposing scrum-half.

**Condition:** If the opposing fly-half is positioned on the blindside, our wing hides behind the scrum.

**Execution:**
1. The blindside wing receives directly from the scrum-half
2. Aims for the inside shoulder of the opposing 12
3. Objective: beat the opposing scrum-half in the race
4. The outside center runs straight and at the last moment seeks a change of direction toward the outside shoulder of the opposing 12
5. The fly-half drifts behind the outside center
6. The inside center drifts outward with time to receive a possible pass from the fly-half

**Options:**
- Blindside wing can pass to the outside center
- Blindside wing can pass to the fly-half

**Numerical superiority:** If the play is executed behind the outside center, it creates a favorable 4 vs 3.

**Important:** The fly-half must not leave before receiving the pass. The inside center must be close for quality passing and straighten with their running line so the defense doesn't drift.

## Midfield Plays

### Chiefs

**Initial positioning:**
Fly-half and fullback standing behind the scrum.

**Execution:**
1. When the ball is coming out, both move toward the right
2. The scrum-half attacks and passes on the run to the inside center (12)
3. The inside center takes and drives inward with force
4. Inside center's objective: fix the opposing outside center or failing that, the opposing fly-half
5. This creates opportunities for the fullback and wings outside

**Timing:** The movement begins exactly when the ball is coming out of the scrum.

---

### Waikato

**Initial positioning:**
Fly-half and fullback standing behind the scrum.

**Execution:**
1. When the ball is coming out, both move toward the left
2. A bufetero (cross) is executed between the outside center and the fullback
3. The pass can go:
   - To the outside center short (first option)
   - To the fullback long looping behind (second option)

**Difference from Chiefs:** The direction (left vs right) and the bufetero involves the fullback instead of a direct penetrator.

---

## General Principles

### Timing and Synchronization
- Multiple options must present themselves simultaneously
- The ball carrier must maintain constant threat with the ball
- Movements must be hidden until the last moment

### Communication
- Clear and early calls
- Real-time defense reading
- On-the-fly adjustments based on opponent response

### Execution
- Constant depth in running lines
- Angle changes at the last moment
- Pass quality always prioritized over speed

### Decision Criteria
- Read spaces before marking players
- Fix defenders before releasing
- Straighten when there's outside space
